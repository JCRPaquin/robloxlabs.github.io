        <p><a href="https://github.com/ROBLOX">The ROBLOX on GitHub organization</a> is used to host and group together projects related to ROBLOX and allow developers to collaborate on them. This makes it easier to find projects related to ROBLOX on GitHub and makes it easier for developers to collaborate on repositories, for repositories that are meant for collaboration. You can request to become a member of the organization or to get a repository hosted on this organization by asking on the issue manager of the organization's website's repository or by contacting <a href="https://github.com/Sauraus">the user "Sauraus" on GitHub</a>. There are no requirements for joining the organization or hosting a repository on it. The organization was created by <a href="http://mark-otaris.github.io">Mark Otaris</a> in 2013 and was later transferred to <a href="http://corp.roblox.com">the ROBLOX Corporation</a>, which now has ownership of it, but does not explicitly endorse it.</p>
